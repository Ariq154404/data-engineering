Profile:

Ariq Rahman is a highly skilled Data Engineer with a strong background in data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, and ETL processes. He has a Master's degree in Applied Computing, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, and holds certifications in TensorFlow and Azure Associate Data Scientist. Ariq has a proven track record of optimizing data processes, creating efficient data models, and automating tasks to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Personal Projects:

1. **MLops on AWS:** Ariq implemented MLops on AWS SageMaker, using a Kaggle dataset of tweets about climate change. He performed data preprocessing, label encoding, tokenization with the Roberta model, and stored the model into a feature store. He used Python libraries such as sklearn, multiprocessing, transformer, numpy, pandas, tensorflow, argparse, and boto3.

2. **A/B testing on questionnaire dataset:** Ariq conducted A/B testing on a dataset from Kaggle, calculating the p-value for the test. He used Python libraries including numpy, pandas, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib, math, and statsmodel.

3. **AWS orchestration of bit-coin forecast:** Ariq used AWS Event Bridge to orchestrate multiple notebooks that included a model to forecast bitcoin prices. The notebooks were run in AWS SageMaker, with each event triggering the next stage of the pipeline. He used Python libraries such as boto3, sagemaker, pickle, matplotlib, and pandas.

4. **Data Engineering with llm:** Ariq automated the tailoring of resumes using a large language model (llm). He created an ETL DAG using Apache Airflow, extracted job descriptions, filtered out keywords using llm, created a data model in Cassandra, and stored the extracted keywords.

5. **Software Engineering project:** Ariq collaborated with classmates to locate different water fountains at the University of Windsor. He coded the backend for the project, implemented different design patterns, created Flask-based APIs, and deployed the API in Heroku. He used Python libraries such as Pandas and Flask.

Work Experience:

1. **Data Analytics Intern at TD Bank of Canada (April-August 2023):** Ariq automated ServiceNow queries and downloaded files as part of the ETL process. He created dashboards in PowerBI, using optimized PowerQuery for ETL processes, and made data models in PowerBI.

2. **Artificial Intelligence Engineer at Intelligent Machines (Sept 2021-April 2022):** Ariq worked on a handwritten text recognition project for Unilever Bangladesh, performing data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, and training deep learning classification models. He also worked on a sound matching project, designing and programming an algorithm that optimized matching time by 300%.

Education:
