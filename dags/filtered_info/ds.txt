Personal Projects:

1. MLops on AWS: Ariq performed MLops on AWS Sagemaker, using a Kaggle dataset of tweets about climate change. He conducted preprocessing, label encoding, tokenization with the Roberta model, and supervised learning. 

2. A/B testing on questionnaire dataset: Ariq conducted A/B testing on a survey dataset, calculating the p-value and utilizing Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Math, and Statsmodel.

3. Climate Change tweet classification: Ariq trained three models (Bert, Roberta, and Google Flan T5) on a climate change dataset, performing hyperparameter tuning and exploratory data analysis.

4. Movie recommendation on AWS: Ariq developed a movie recommendation system based on the IMDB dataset, using AWS technologies. He also created a data analysis pipeline using AWS Glue, AWS Athena, and AWS Quicksight.

5. AWS orchestration of bitcoin forecast: Ariq used AWS Event Bridge to orchestrate multiple notebooks for forecasting bitcoin prices. The notebooks were run in AWS Sagemaker, with each event triggering the next stage of the pipeline.

Work Experience:

1. Data Analytics Intern at TD Bank of Canada (April-August 2023): Ariq automated Servicenow queries and created dashboards in PowerBI, optimizing the ETL process and reducing query run time by 40%.

2. Artificial Intelligence Engineer at Intelligent Machines (Sept 2021-April 2022): Ariq worked on a handwritten text recognition project and a sound matching project, improving post-processing time by 500% and optimizing matching time by 300%, respectively.
