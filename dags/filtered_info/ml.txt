Profile:

Ariq Rahman is a skilled Machine Learning professional with a strong background in data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. He has a Master's degree in Applied Computing, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, and holds certifications in TensorFlow and Azure Data Science. Ariq has a proven track record of implementing machine learning models in real-world projects, optimizing algorithms, and improving business outcomes.

Relevant Personal Projects:

1. MLops on AWS: Ariq implemented MLops on AWS SageMaker, using a Kaggle dataset of tweets about climate change. He performed data preprocessing, label encoding, tokenization with the Roberta model, and supervised learning for classification tasks.

2. A/B testing on questionnaire dataset: Ariq conducted A/B testing on a survey dataset, calculating p-values and utilizing Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib, math, and statsmodel.

3. Climate Change tweet classification: Ariq trained three models (BERT, Roberta, and Google Flan T5) on a climate change dataset, performed hyperparameter tuning, and tracked the experiment on the Wandb MLops platform.

4. AWS orchestration of bitcoin forecast: Ariq used AWS Event Bridge to orchestrate multiple notebooks for forecasting bitcoin prices. The notebooks were run on AWS SageMaker, with each stage of the pipeline triggered by an event.

5. IEEE Cis Fraud detection: Ariq participated in a binary classification project to detect fraudulent papers. He performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and implemented an ensemble of neural network and decision tree for classification.

Work Experience:

1. Data Analytics Intern at TD Bank of Canada (April-August 2023): Ariq automated ServiceNow queries using Python Selenium and created dashboards in PowerBI. He optimized PowerQuery for ETL, reducing query run time by 40%.

2. Artificial Intelligence Engineer at Intelligent Machines (Sept 2021-April 2022): Ariq worked on a handwritten text recognition project for Unilever Bangladesh, performing data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. He also worked on a sound matching project, designing an algorithm that optimized matching time by 300%.
