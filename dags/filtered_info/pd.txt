Profile:

Ariq Rahman is a skilled Python Developer with a strong background in data analysis, machine learning, and software engineering. He has a proven track record of developing and implementing complex projects using Python and its associated libraries. His expertise includes data preprocessing, machine learning model training, A/B testing, and creating data pipelines. He is also proficient in using AWS services for data storage and model deployment.

Personal Projects:

1. **MLops on AWS:** Ariq developed a machine learning model on AWS SageMaker using Python libraries such as sklearn, multiprocessing, transformer, numpy, pandas, tensorflow, argparse, and boto3. He performed data preprocessing, label encoding, tokenization, and model training for a classification task on a climate change tweets dataset.

2. **A/B testing on questionnaire dataset:** Ariq conducted A/B testing on a dataset using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib, math, and statsmodel. He calculated the p-value for the A/B testing.

3. **Climate Change tweet classification:** Ariq trained three models (bert, roberta, and google flan t5) on a climate change tweets dataset. He performed hyperparameter tuning and exploratory data analysis using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, spacy, nlkt, geopy, geopandas, tensorflow, huggingface, sklearn, and keras tuner.

4. **Shell Script:** Ariq wrote a shell script in Unix to monitor all current user processes. If any processes had more than n descendants, the script would output the process tree with p as the root on the standard output using pstree -p.

5. **Software Engineering project:** Ariq collaborated with five other classmates on a software engineering project at the University of Windsor. He coded the backend for the project using Python and Flask, implemented different design patterns, created APIs, and deployed the API on Heroku. He also wrote several unit tests for different modules.

Work Experience:

1. **Data Analytics Intern at TD Bank of Canada (April-August 2023):** Ariq automated servicenow queries and downloads using Python selenium script as part of the ETL process. He also created dashboards in PowerBI using optimized powerquery for ETL process and made data models in PowerBI.

2. **Artificial Intelligence Engineer at Intelligent Machines (Sept 2021-April 2022):** Ariq worked on a handwritten text recognition project and a sound matching project. He performed data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, and model training using Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, and Keras.

Education:

1. Master of Applied Computing in Artificial Intelligence Stream, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario (May 2022-August 2023)
2. Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, Islamic University of Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh (January 2016-November 2019)

Certifications:

1. Tensorflow Developer Certification
2. Azure Associate Data Scientist Certification (DP-100)
